This is a graphics / demo engine written in Rust, using wgpu for rendering. The primary target platforms are Windows and macOS.

## General guidelines

- When presenting multiple options, describe the options to the user. Do not implement the options directly before asking for confirmation.
- Do not create example files, unless explicitly requested.
- This project doesn't have any external users, so breaking changes are acceptable. You can usually change the API without having to maintain backward compatibility.
